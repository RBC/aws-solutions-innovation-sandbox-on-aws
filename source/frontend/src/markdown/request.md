title: Request Lease
---

The **Request Lease** page allows you to request a new sandbox account for experimentation, learning, and innovation with AWS services.

**Lease Request** is the self-service method for obtaining temporary access to an AWS sandbox account with predefined budget and duration limits.

---

**Step 1: Select Lease Template**
Choose from available public lease templates that match your intended use case. Each template defines the budget limits, duration, and approval requirements for the sandbox account.

**Template Information**:

- **Description**: Purpose and intended use of the template
- **Max Budget**: Maximum spending limit (if configured)
- **Duration**: How long the lease will remain active
- **Approval**: Whether the request requires manual approval or is auto-approved
- **Visibility**: Only public templates are available for user requests

**Step 2: Terms of Service**
Review and accept the terms of service for using sandbox accounts. These terms outline your responsibilities for using AWS resources responsibly and within the defined limits.

**Step 3: Review & Submit**
Review your lease request details and optionally add comments explaining your intended use case. This information helps Admins and Managers understand your needs when reviewing approval requests.

**After Submission**

**If Approval Required**:

- Your request will be sent to all Admins and Managers for review
- You will receive an email notification when your request is approved or denied
- The lease duration starts only after your request is approved
- You can view the status of your request on the home page

**If Auto-Approved**:

- Your lease will be created immediately
- You will receive an email notification with account access details
- You can begin using your sandbox account right away

**Request Status**:

- **Pending Approval**: Waiting for Admin/Manager review

**Important Notes**

- You can only see and request from public lease templates
- Private templates are only available through direct assignment by Admins/Managers
- You may have a limit on the number of concurrent leases you can hold
- Your remaining budget and lease duration will be displayed in "My Accounts"
- To access your approved sandbox account, choose **Login to account** from the home page

**Common Denial Reasons**:

- Unavailability of additional budget for sandbox experiments
- No accounts available in the account pool
- You have exceeded the maximum number of leases allowed per user
- Insufficient justification for the requested resources

If your request is denied, contact your Admin to understand the reason and consider resubmitting with additional information.
