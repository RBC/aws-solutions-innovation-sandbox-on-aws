title: Approvals
---

The **Approvals** page displays the current list of pending lease requests.

An Admin or a Manager can approve or deny sandbox requests. They are notified via email when a new request is pending review. When a request is approved, an account from the available account pool is automatically leased to the sandbox user requesting the lease.

Requests from sandbox users are sent to all Admins and Managers for review. Any Admin or Manager can approve or deny a sandbox request on a first-come first-serve basis.

**Note**: Sandbox requests with no approvals required and leases created through direct assignment are not displayed on this page. Auto-approved requests and assigned leases provide users with immediate access to their AWS accounts.

For more information on how to action sandbox requests, refer to the [Approving and rejecting leases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/innovation-sandbox-on-aws/manager-guide.html#approve-reject-account-lease) page.
